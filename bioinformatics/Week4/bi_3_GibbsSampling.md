# Gibbs Sampling
- A more iterative algorithm compared to random motif search we made.
    - discards a single kmer from current set of motifs at each iteration 
    - decides to keep or replace with new one
    - moves with mroe caution in space of all motifs
    - ![random vs gibs](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/images/Motifs/randomized_vs_gibbs.png "from stepik.org gibs vs random")
- starts with randomly chosen kmers in each t DNA strings
    - but makes a *random* choice at each iteration.
    - uses list t randomly selected kmer motifs to come up with another set kmers
    - randomly selects int i between 0 and t-1 and randomly changes a single kmer motif[i]
- Note: there will be a problem with 0's again so we have to use pseudocounts once again
