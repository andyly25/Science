# Motif Finding meets Oliver Cromwell
- 1650, Oliver Cromwell made a famous appeal to Church of Scotland wrge them see errors of their royal alliance
    - his quote inspired a statistical maxim called: **Cromwell's rule**
        - we should not use probabilities of 0 or 1 unless we are talking about logical statements of True or False
        - We should allow a small probability for extremely unlikely events
- To improve unfair scoring, we substitute zeroes with small numbers called **pseudocounts**
    - one introduction is through **Laplace's Rule of Succession**
        - this is similar to the principles that was used to calculate prob. sun will rise tomorrow
        - For our case we will add 1 to each elements in our Count(Motifs)
- Then from the last lesson, we just applied this concept to our Count and Profile
    - Then fix all our functions to apply it... so it was mostly a copy and paste. 
- Using this method to solve Subtle Motif Problem returns a collection of 15-mers Motifs with Score(Motifs) = 41 and Consensus(Motifs) = "AAAAAtAgaGGGGtt".
    - compared to "gttAAAtAgaGatGtG" with Score(Motifs) = 58 of the previous algorithm we made
