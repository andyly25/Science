# Quiz 2
1. True or False: Deamination is more likely to occur when DNA is double-stranded than when it is single-stranded.
    - False
2. The position of the E. coli genome at which the skew attains a maximum value is most likely near which of the following?
    - the replication terminus
3. In Python, the expression 8.7//4 is equal to what?
    - 2
4. Identify the value of i for which the skew array of "CATTCCAGTACTTCGATGATGGCGTGAAGA" attains a maximum value.
    - Report the position of the first occurrence only, with 1-based numeration (i.e. Skew[1] corresponds to "C" here)
    - 29 and the second would be position 30
5. Given the following code in Python:

```python
x=0
# Don't forget about definition of range. starts, but stops and not including the last
for y in range(0,5):
    x+=y
print(x)
```
- what will be the output?
    - 10
6. Compute the Hamming distance between "CTACAGCAATACGATCATATGCGGATCCGCAGTGGCCGGTAGACACACGT" and
    - "CTACCCCGCTGCTCAATGACCGGGACTAAAGAGGCGAAGATTATGGTGTG".
    - 36
7. The Python code:

```python
a=list(range(5))
b=a
a[2]=12
```
- results in which of the following?
    - b = [0, 1, 12, 3, 4]
8. True or False: DnaA can bind to “imperfect” DnaA boxes that have point mutations.
    - True
