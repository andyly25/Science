# The Circadian Clock
- **circadian clock**: internal timekeeper of animal, plants, and bacteria
    - can malfunction causing a genetic disease called **delayed sleep-phase syndrome (DSPS)**
    - Question: how do individ. cells in animals and plants know what time it is?
        - can we explain why heart attacks occurs more in morning and asthma attacks at night?
        - can we identify the gene that can cause DSPS?
    - Early 1970s, Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer identified mutant flies with abnormal circadian patterns to single gene.
        - 20 years later to find the genes in mammals and some having names of timeless, clock, cycle
    - We'll first focus on plants, since vital for plants and their photosynthesis, flowering and etc

## Gene Expression
- **Central Dogma of Moelecular Biology**: DNA makes RNA makes protein
    - DNA corresponding to gene is **transcribed** into a strand of RNA composed of 4 **ribonucleotides**
        - adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) (replaces thymine)
        - gets translated into amino acid sequence of protein
        - Transcription replaces all occurences of T in DNA with U 
            - **codons**: 3-mers that the RNA strand is partitioned into
            - then each codon -> one of 20 amino acids by genetic code
                - the whole sequence represented as **amino acid string**
                - each of the 64 RNA codons encodes its own amino acid
                    - exception: 3 **stop codon** which halts translation
- **Gene expression**: Variance in production of a gene's transcript
    - cells able to transcribe different genes into RNA at different rates
    - explains why brain and skin cell can have same DNA but behave differently
    - Table below describe translation of RNA 3 mer (codon) into one of 20 amino acids
