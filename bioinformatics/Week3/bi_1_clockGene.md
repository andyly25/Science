# The Circadian Clock
- **circadian clock**: internal timekeeper of animal, plants, and bacteria
    - can malfunction causing a genetic disease called **delayed sleep-phase syndrome (DSPS)**
    - Question: how do individ. cells in animals and plants know what time it is?
        - can we explain why heart attacks occurs more in morning and asthma attacks at night?
        - can we identify the gene that can cause DSPS?
    - Early 1970s, Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer identified mutant flies with abnormal circadian patterns to single gene.
        - 20 years later to find the genes in mammals and some having names of timeless, clock, cycle
    - We'll first focus on plants, since vital for plants and their photosynthesis, flowering and etc
