# Motif finding is more difficult than you think
- NOTE: circadian behavior as CB, ^ means increased/elevated
- 2000: Steve Key used **DNA arrays** to determine which genes in plant Arabidopsis thaliana activated at different times of the day.
    - extracted upstream regions of ~500 genes exhibiting circadian behavior 
    - looking for freq. patterns AAAATATCT appeared 46 times
    - namd that pattern the **evening element**
        - proved it by mutating that evening element in upstream region of one gene and it lost its CB
- Evening element in plants is very conserved and easier to find as opposed to motifs with many mutations
    - e.g. with a fly if you infect with some bacterium, will activate its **immunity gene** to fight 
        - thus some genes with ^ expressions after infection are immunity genes
            - NF-kB: binding site of a transcription factor activates varous immunity genes in flies

## Detour: **DNA Arrays**
- a collection of DNA molecules attached to a solid surface.
    - Each spot on array assigned unique DNA string called **probe**
        - measures expression level of a specific gene (**target**)
        - probes are synthesized and attached to glass or silicon chip
    - Fluorescently labled targers bing to corres. probe, generating a signal
        - strength depends upon amount of target sample that bings to probe at given location
            - ^ expression level of gene, ^ intensity of fluorescent signal on array
- since an array can contain millions of probes, can meaure many genes in a single experiment
- DNA experiment identifying evening element measured expression of 8000 genes
