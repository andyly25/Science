# Some hidden messages are more suprising than others
- A and T, C and G are complements
    - having one strand of DNA and a supply of free floating nucleotides 
    - Messelson and Stahl in 1958 confirmed this model (considered most beautiful experiment in Biology)
        - ![complementary strands run in opposite directions](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/images/Replication/reverse_complement.png "complementary strands run in opposite directions, from stepik.org")
        - the beginning and end of DNA strands denoted 5' (five prime) and 3'.
            - each dna strand read in 5' -> 3' direction and complementary runs opposite
        - DETOUR: 1950's biologists debated 3 models of DNA replication
            - **semiconservative**: each parent strand acts as template for synthesis of daughter strand
                - result each daughter mol. contains one parent and newly synthesized
            - **conservative**: entire double stranded DNA mol. served as template for new daughter.
                - result one mol with 2 parent strands and another with 2 newly synthesized strands
            - **dispersive**: some mechanism breaks DNA backbone into pieces and splices intervals of synth. DNA
                - each daughter molecules is a patchwork of old and new double stranded DNA

            - Knowing DNA struct. contains $^14$N (not sure if this will add superscript) and is more abundant than $^15$N, Messelson and Stahl gre E. coli in $^15$N medium causing bacteria gain weight
                - once bacterial DNA saturated with $^15$N, transfered bacteria to less dense $^14$N
