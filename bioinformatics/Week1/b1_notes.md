# A Journey of a Thousand Miles...
- **Genome Replication**: An important task carried out in the cell where
    - cell must first replicate its genome so each of two daughter cells can inherit own copy
    - 1953 *James Watson* and *Francis Crick* completed their paper on DNA double helix.
        - comments below mentions: that those two relied on a lot data collected from other scientists
            - Notable is largely uncredited photo 51 from Rosalind Franklin
        - conjectured the two strands of parent DNA unwinds during replication
            - Each act as template for synthesis of new strand.
            - Begins with pair of complementary strands, ends with two pairs of complementary strands

                - A : Nucleotides Adenine
                - T : Thymine
                - C : Cytosine
                - G : Guanine
                - A <=> T, C <=> G (Assuming my <=> means complements)
