# Course introduction

1. Recall the elemtns that are most abundant in living organisms
2. Describe the unique properties of carbon that make it the backbone of many of the molecules of life.
3. Explain how the atoms involved in a bond contribute to geometry, strngth, and electron density of that bond.

- in periodic table **major** elements is:
    - Earth crust has abundance in: Si, Al, Fe, Ca
    - H, C, N, O, Na, P, S, Cl, K, Ca
        - O (65%), C (18%), H (10%), N (3%) makes up 95% weight of human body
        - why is there so much C in living organisms?
            - asside from water, majority of biomolecules is carbon based
            - Efficient to use one atom for a lot of purposes
            - a lot of shapes: linear, branched, cyclical
            - leads to functional diversity
- **Carbon** atom has 6 protons, 6 neutrons, 6 electrons
    - e- distributed in space with specific shapes called **orbitals**
        - first two orbitals containg 2 e- are spherical and called "1s" and "2s" (farther from orbital)
        - 3 equiv. barbell shaped orbitals called 2px, 2py, 2pz
        - remaining 2 e- are unpaired leaving 2pz unoccupied
            - recall **covalent bonds**: formed when one orbital for each atom carrying an unpaired e- fuse into molecular orbital, now containing 2 e-
                - you think with 2 unpaired can only form 2 covalent bonds, except there's methane with 4
                - e- in carbon can shift around and one from 2s can be promoted to 2pz orbital
                - now with 3 2p and 2s makes 4, but unequal bonds are very unstable
                - must now undergo process called **hybridization**
                    - equalizes the characteristics of 4 unpaired e- so newly formed sp3 orbitasls have 25% S character, and 75% P character
                    - They spread into space as far as possible with 4 identical bond at 109.5 degrees from one another
                    - C occupies center of the "tetrahedron"
                - can bond with 3 atoms e.g. ethylene (plant hormone) with 2 H and 1 C
                    - one e- from 2s promoted to 2p, and only 3 hybrid orbitals formed.
                    - these are now sp2 orbitals and have 33% S character and 67% P character
                    - in planar, trigonal struct. 120 deg. apart from another
                    - remaining unpaired occupies 2pz orbital and orthogonal to plane containing sp2
                    - To make ethylene 2 trigonal structures come together
                    - fuses head to head to form a **sigma covalent** bond between 2 C
                        - sideways overlap of two 2pz orbitals leads to a **pi bond** between 2 C
                - then triple bond e.g. acetylene (C2H2) 
- in periodic table **trace** elements is:
    - Mg, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo, I
- they combine to form a large number of biomolecules that varies
___
- What are the consequences of various types of bonds?
    - different bonds affects geometry and reactivity of biomolecules. 
    - Consider 3 characteristics: Length, Bond strength, and EN
        - Length (A)
            - shape of molecule determined by type of atom's bond
            - bond of N and O is shorter than bond of 2 C
            - shape also determined if a single or double bond
                - length of double is shorter than if with single
        - Bond Strength (kcal/mol)
            - bond of double bond is stronger than single bond, but not twice as high
                - pi bond weaker than sigma bond
                - presence of double bond ^ reactivity of molecule
                    - bond is weaker and break easily
        - Electronegativity (triangle EN or let's call it ^EN)
            - When two different atoms are engaged in covalent bond, one atom has a stronger pull on e-
                - the difference in ^EN determine relative position of e- in molecular orbit between two atoms
                - The trick: bottom left to top right of periodic table for increasing strength
