# Learning Objectives
- Describe the difference between conformation and configuration
- Identify the chiral carbons in a given molecule

- Identity is not only determined by atomic compositions
    - maleic and fumaric acids have the same composition
        - double bond blocks free roation around C-C axis
        - are said to have different configuration called: **stereoisomers**
