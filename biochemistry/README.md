Intro to structures of macromolecules and biochemical approach to celluar function. 

I'll be taking the Harvard Principles of Biochemistry course

## What I'll learn
- structure and function of chemical building blocks of life
- navigate protein structures using PyMOL
- central role of enzymes in catalyzing reactions of life
- primary metabolic pathways that power cells
- mechanisms that regulate celluar metabolism
- integration of biochem. processes in context of cels and etc...
- how metabolic disturbances linked to various human diseases
